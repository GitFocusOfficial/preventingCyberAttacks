        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In the Philippines, the rapid growth of Information Communication Technology (ICT) has fueled social, economic, and cultural development.
            However, with increased connectivity, the nation faces rising cybersecurity threats.
            High-profile cyber incidents, like the Medusa ransomware attack on PhilHealth and the DDoS attack during the 2022 elections, reveal the vulnerabilities in the country’s digital landscape.
            These threats underscore the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect citizens, government institutions, and private sectors alike.
